"# Data-Structures-Generics-Assignment" 

This is a recent assignment from my Data Structures class on the topic of generics. The program reads in an initial database of bank accounts and prints the database 13 times. Once unsorted, and then sorted using generic algorithms for bubble, insersion, and quick sort, according to the account holder's social security number, name, account number, and account balance. The program will then thoroughly test all possible transactions (balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, clear check, close account, reopen account, new account, delete account, account info (no transaction history), and account info(with transaction history). After the tests are complete, the updated database is once again printed 13 times, sorted and unsorted, before the program exits.

This was the most difficult assignment of my degree so far in both scope and complexity. Writing three different sorting algorithms which are capable of sorting multiple different data types was challenging and required me to study both generics and comparators. The sorting algorithms are in the Bank class and are named genericBubbleSort, genericInsertionSort, genericQuickSort.

To run, clone this repository to your local machine and open the HW17 package in your Java text editor.
